My year is 2027
My major is Cybersecurity
One of my hobbies is traveling, I like road trips. I also enjoy listening to music, binge-watching shows, and spending time with family and friends. One fun achievement is that I played soccer when I was younger 
My academic goal is to pass all classes and keep my good GPA. Also, to enjoy the semester. I would love to enjoy coding because I haven't had the best experiences.
